## Approach Taken
First I looked into easy APIs to use. Then I decided to build a project around it. I decided to use the top NY Times headlines because I am a total news junkie. I focused on building one div at a time. So the first day I worked on getting the article headlines to load and get an iFrame to load with the story. However, I abadoned the iFrame when I learned that the 10 article limit still applies. Then I worked an adding it to my list and adding a note. That is when I realized that I my current project was a bit advanced, but decided to use it as a learning opportunity. 


## Screenshots

Then you can click to read an abstract, get the link, and add it to your article list

Then you can add a note, when you edit the note, it will display the old note.

## Wireframe

I decided to try to wireframe using pen and paper to decide what wireframe method I like the most. I like it better than whiteboarding for this project, but I also found it was more time consuming when it comes to making changes. When I decided to get rid of my notes div, I didn't re-wireframe because I knew what my plan was and I thought it would be too time consuming. 

## MVP
-Get the article headlines to load in one div
-In a new div, get the article headline, abstract, and URL to load.
-Then in a third div get the article headline to be added along with an editable note.

## Unsolved Problems
- Get rid of the add note button when the edit function is activated.
- Be able to delete the note.
