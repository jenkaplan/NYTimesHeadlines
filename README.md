## Wireframe

I decided to try to wireframe using pen and paper to decide what wireframe method I like the most. I like it better than whiteboarding for this project, but I also found it was more time consuming when it comes to making changes. When I decided to get rid of my notes div, I didn't re-wireframe because I knew what my plan was and I thought it would be too time consuming.
